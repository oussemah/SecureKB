SecureKB
========

This project is about using an MCU board (any MCU that's able to communicate through UART) to encrypt keyboard strokes before they are handled by the operating system.

In this precise example I ll provide the MCU code for an STM32L and an ARDUINO code.
The x86 part should be the same (or almost) no matter the MCU used.

I tested this on my Toshiba laptop hosting a Linux Mint 16.

Please feel free to comment, update and especially SHARE.
